# Welcome

Example of using Openmaize authentication library in a Phoenix web application.

## Example apps

The example on this branch is based on version 2.1 of Openmaize.
It just shows an example of a new Phoenix app just after running the
command `mix openmaize.gen.phoenixauth --confirm`. See
[this guide](https://github.com/riverrun/openmaize/blob/master/phoenix_new_openmaize.md)
for more information about setting up a new app with Openmaize.

There is also an example app on the `old_admin` branch, which is based
on older versions (greater than 2.0) of Openmaize. This older version
has more features, such as support for two-factor authentication and
authorization based on user roles.
